Phase 1 Algorithm

Vestia’s cold-start recommendation engine computes a weighted compatibility score between a base item and candidate items using a combination of:
	•	color compatibility probabilities
	•	category transition likelihoods
	•	item co-occurrence frequencies
	•	price similarity
	•	style overlap

All weights are derived from publicly available fashion datasets and normalized prior to deployment.
